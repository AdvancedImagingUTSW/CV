\forceindent As a scientist, I am driven to develop and apply cutting-edge imaging technologies that provide molecular insight into incredibly complex biological processes and systems.  My scientific training spans multiple disciplines, including biology, biochemistry, computer vision, fluorescence microscopy, and optical probes (including optogenetics, chemogenetics, and biosensors), and I have a strong history of leading and completing highly-technical, interdisciplinary, and collaborative research projects.
